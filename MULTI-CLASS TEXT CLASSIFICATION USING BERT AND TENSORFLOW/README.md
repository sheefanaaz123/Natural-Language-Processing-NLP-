# Customer Grievance Categorization with BERT and TensorFlow

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution for categorizing customer grievances. Customer grievances can take various forms, spanning issues related to service quality, access and availability, billing disputes, benefit packages, and marketing concerns. The project leverages BERT and TensorFlow to train a sophisticated classification model capable of accurately categorizing text descriptions into relevant grievance categories.

## Key Features

- **BERT Integration:** The model utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art pre-trained language representation model, to capture intricate contextual relationships within the text.

- **TensorFlow Implementation:** TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, is employed to build, train, and deploy the classification model efficiently.

- **Multi-Class Categorization:** The model is designed to classify customer grievances into multiple categories, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the nature of each grievance.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse customer grievances in various domains.
